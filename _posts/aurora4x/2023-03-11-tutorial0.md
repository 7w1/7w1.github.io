# Intro

Aurora 4x is painful to learn, so I'm attempting to write a basic guide/tutorial that walks you through a playthrough without any of the extra stuff that seems to plague most tutorials. I'm by no means an expert at this game, so if you find any issues please let me know in the comments below, github, or anywhere you can reach me.

Now, before we get into this, as much as I'll try to explain everything you need to know, I also want to keep this simple and understandable. I'm going to explain as we play the game, which means you might get lost (for example, encountering aliens far before I do). If you do happen to get stuck, browse the wiki, ask in the comments, ask on reddit, ask on the forums, ask in a discord server---just don't stop playing. You'll be learning new things in Aurora 4x everyday and you'll mess things up everyday. Don't get discouraged from learning because the game is hard, just persevere because it will pay off. This game is *really* fun once you get the hang of it.

Lastly, I suck at this game. I don't know what I'm doing. Question me every step of the way, you very well might have better ideas then me, and I'll work to revise this guide as time goes on.

> You can ask for help in the comments, but the best place for instant answers is the [community discord server](https://discord.gg/Q5ryqdW "Seriously, join."){:target="_blank"}.

# Installation

> If you've already installed Aurora 4x, feel free to jump to [modding](https://7w1.github.io/posts/tutorial0/#modding-optional) or [part 0.5](https://7w1.github.io/posts/tutorial0-5/).
{: .prompt-info }

> All images are clickable, if something isn't visible due to the small font size, you can click to open the image's full resolution.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Aurora 4x is only supported on windows.
> For linux, you can attempt to run Aurora 4x through wine, but I have not gotten around to testing it on my machine.
> For macOS (or linux), you can try running [Quasar4x](https://ozer0.itch.io/quasar4x "A clone of Aurora 4x vb6."){:target="_blank"} which is a clone of the old Aurora 4x vb6 version (meaning there will be a lot of differences) but has compatibility with all operating systems.

## Base Game

First off, download the base game from here: [Aurora 4x 1.13.0](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=10635.0 "Aurora 4x Version 1.13.0"){:target="_blank"}

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial0/download1.png)

That download contains version 1.3.0, you'll want to unzip it and place it in a folder somewhere. That will be the folder you run the game out of.

> It is good practice to avoid using protected windows directories like **Program Files**, **Program Files (x86)**, or **Windows**. I would recommend you install the game in a new folder at the root of your drive, e.g. **C:\Aurora4x**.
{: .prompt-danger }

> You might need to download a file archiver (like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "7zip File Archiver"){:target="_blank"} or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/ "WinRAR File Archiver"){:target="_blank"}) to extract the files. They are compressed as **.rar** files.

## Patches

Next, download this: [Aurora 4x 2.1.0 Patch](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13049.0 "Aurora 4x Version 2.1.0 Patch"){:target="_blank"}

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial0/download2.png)

And this: [Aurora 4x 2.1.1 Patch](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13077.0 "Aurora 4x Version 2.1.1 Patch"){:target="_blank"}

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial0/download3.png)

Those are both patches, you'll want to extract them *in the same folder* as the existing game files, replacing when necessary.

And that's it. You now have a perfectly playable version of Aurora 4x. However, I would recommend some very simple ui mods to make the colors a bit less intense.

## Modding (Optional)

This section is 100% optional, but the images in this guide will use these ui mods.

### AuroraPatch

This is a base dependency for most(?) mods.

Download it here: [AuroraPatch Latest](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch/releases "Aurora Patch Latest Release"){:target="_blank"}

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial0/aurorapatch.png)

And extract the files into the same directory as the base game, following the same steps as installing the patches.

### Themes

Next up, lets choose a theme. Below I have instructions for a dark theme and a light theme, or you can choose to not install either and use the default blue theme.

#### Solaris Theme (Dark Theme)

> The rest of this tutorial will use this theme.
{: .prompt-info }

This is a theme that replaces colors and icons, making them a bit less intense on the eyes.

_Solaris Theme Preview_

Download it here: [Solaris Theme Latest](https://github.com/simast/SolarisTheme/releases "Solaris Theme Latest Release"){:target="_blank"}

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial0/solaris0.png)
_Download of Solaris Theme files._

And extract the files into the **Patches** folder inside the base game directory.

#### Polaris Theme (Light Theme)

This theme has a settings menu!

_Polaris Theme Preview_

Download it here: [Polaris Theme Latest](https://github.com/quasar-kyle/PolarisTheme/releases "Polaris Theme Latest Release"){:target="_blank"}

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial0/polaris0.png)
_Download of Polaris Theme files._

You need to download both **PolarisTheme.zip** and **ThemeCreator.zip**.

And extract the files into the **Patches** folder inside the base game directory.

_Extraction of Solaris Theme files._

The image above uses Solaris' files, but it is the same process, just extract both of the zips into the patches folder.

### Additional Tools (Very Optional)

These tools won't be mentioned in the rest of the tutorial, but can be helpful for some players.

#### [AuroraMarvin](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=12233.0){:target="_blank"}

A helpful tool to display some organized information about your save. Updates everytime you press save.

#### [Iceranger's Missile and Ship Optimizer](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=10999.0){:target="_blank"}

Optimizes things! I haven't ever used this, but I'm sure its useful for people who don't suck at the game.

#### [Scrontch's Flag Designer](https://flag-designer.appspot.com/){:target="_blank"}

A pretty cool flag generator!

#### [Auto settings updater and un-updater thing](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=11237.0){:target="_blank"}

I haven't used this, but it might work for the people who need it (you'll know if this applies to you in the next section).

#### [Everything else!](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?board=282.0){:target="_blank"}

There's a nice list of tools that you might want to check out in the future.

#### [Discord!](https://discord.gg/Q5ryqdW){:target="_blank"}

The discord has a channel titled **#aurora-tools**. Check the pins for another list of tools.

# Conclusion

Now, theres just one last step before we can begin playing the game!
