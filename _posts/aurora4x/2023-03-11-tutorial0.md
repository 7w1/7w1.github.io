# Intro

Aurora 4x is painful to learn, so I'm attempting to write a basic guide/tutorial that walks you through a playthrough without any of the extra stuff that seems to plague most tutorials. I'm by no means an expert at this game, so if you find any issues please let me know in the comments below, github, or anywhere you can reach me.

Now, before we get into this, as much as I'll try to explain everything you need to know, I also want to keep this simple and understandable. I'm going to explain as we play the game, which means you might get lost (for example, encountering aliens far before I do). If you do happen to get stuck, ask in the comments, ask on reddit, browse the wiki, ask in a discord server---just don't stop playing. You'll be learning new things in Aurora 4x everyday and you'll mess things up everyday. Don't get discouraged from learning because the game is hard, just persevere because it will pay off. This game is *really* fun once you get the hang of it.

Lastly, I suck at this game. I don't know what I'm doing. Question me every step of the way, you very well might have better ideas then me, and I'll work to revise this guide as time goes on.

## Base Game

First off, download the base game from here: [Aurora 4x 1.13.0](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=10635.0 "Aurora 4x Version 1.13.0")

That download contains version 1.3.0, you'll want to unzip it and place it in a folder somewhere. That will be the folder you run the game out of.

> You might need to download a file archiver (like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org "7zip File Archiver")) to extract the files. They are compressed as **.rar** files.)

## Patches

Next, download this: [Aurora 4x 2.1.0 Patch](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13049.0 "Aurora 4x Version 2.1.0 Patch")

And this: [Aurora 4x 2.1.1 Patch](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=13077.0 "Aurora 4x Version 2.1.1 Patch")

Those are both patches, you'll want to extract them *in the same folder* as the existing game files, replacing when necessary.

And that's it. You now have a perfectly playable version of Aurora 4x. However, I would recommend some very simple ui mods to make the colors a bit less intense.

## Modding (Optional)

Aurora 4x has a very limited mod selection, however it does have some great ui mods. This section is 100% optional, however this guide will use these ui mods.

Installing these mods (or really mod) will make this guide easier to follow.
