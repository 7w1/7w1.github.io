# Intro

Most of the info here won't apply to everyone, but I would recommend skimming it to ensure your system is properly set up to play Aurora 4x.

> If you haven't installed Aurora 4x yet, check out [part 0](https://7w1.github.io/posts/tutorial0/).
{: .prompt-info }

# Installation

First up, launch your game with **AuroraPatch.exe** if you isntalled mods, or **Aurora.exe** if you are running the base game.

## Resolution

Aurora 4x C# requires a minimum resolution of 1440x900, but I would recommend at least 1920x1080 (which is what I play on). You can also use higher resolutions but you should increase your window scaling.

If your resolution is fine but the Aurora 4x windows are too big, decrease your window scaling.

## Time Format

Some dates and times in Aurora 4x will be partially hidden if you don't use a shorter time format.

You'll want to choose either one of the shorter formats for **Long date**, the long ones get cut off in game.

## Decimal Seperator

Aurora 4x requires the decimal seperator to be set to **.** if it is set to **,** the game will have a multitude of issues and I would not recommend testing it out.

# Done!

And that's it. Everything should work perfectly. Boot up your game (with **AuroraPatch.exe** for modded or **Aurora.exe** for vanilla) and head to [the next section](https://7w1.github.io/posts/tutorial1/ "Doesn't exist yet.") (Not finished yet.)
