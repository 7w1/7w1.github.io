# Starting the game

This part will cover the first few minutes of every game, queuing up your first actions in **industry**, **research**, **shipyards**, and **governor** tabs.

## Industry

To start, let's click on the **Industry** tab.

_Image of opening industry tab._

This is where all of our construction takes place.

The screen is divided into a few sections, although it looks daunting, it's actually pretty simple.

1. On the far left we have our locations. This is how you would switch between planets (once we colonize a few). You can ignore this for now.
2. To the right of that, there are two rows (ignoring the tabs at the top).
    - a. The top section is where you select what you want to build.
    - b. The bottom shows the necessary materials for building one of what you have selected.
3. Then, to the right of that, we have five rows. You can ignore the bottom two for now.
    - a. The very top displays construction capacity, essentially your construction speed.
    - b. The big empty section is where in-progress and queued construction will show up.
    - c. The lower section is where you control the queue (adding, canceling, or rearranging).

The first thing we're going to do is queue up some **Military Academies**. The game starts you off with 1 in a conventional game, but we'll definitely want more.

**Military Academies** are how you gain more officers, scientists, and administrators which you will need to pilot ships, manage colonies, and perform research.

For now, let's build an additional 2 academies.

1. Select **Military Academy** on the left panel.
2. Set the number of items to **2**.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Then, the academies should appear in the construction queue.

You can see that they will be completed in 2030 (for my game at least) which is still a ways off, but don't worry. Five years will pass by pretty quickly in the early game.

## Research

Next, let's queue up some research.

Click on the **Research** tab. Either from the same menu, or the main game screen.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research1.png)
_Image of opening research window._

The research tab is similary divided into sections.

1. You already know what this does from the Industry tab (cycles between worlds).
2. This is just like the industry tab's big empty area, it displays the queue, in this case the research queue.
3. This is where all the magic happens.
    - a. Here you can select the category of research, and toggle only displaying scientists which have their specialty set to that category. I'd recommend toggling that on.
    - b. Here you can see the list of research projects inside of your selected category.
    - c. This is where you can choose how many research labs to assign, and see how many you have remaining (unassigned), respectively.
    - d. This is where you select the researcher you would like to assign to the project.
4. This is where you actually queue the research.
    - **Create Project** starts the research.
    - **Add to Queue** adds the selected research to the queue of whatever you have selected in section 2.
    - **Delete Tech** is for deleting created technology research you don't want. Ignore this for now, you'll rarely need it.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research2.png)
_Image of opening research window._

Let's begin some research.

First, click on the drop down and select **Construction / Production**. While you're here, also tick **Matching Scientists Only**.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research3.png)
_Image of selecting construction/production._

Now, you should see a list of four projects. We're going to start with **Trans-Newtonian Technology**. This is the prerequisite technology for all the fancy space exploration tech.

On the right, you'll want to select one of your scientists who has a **Max Labs** of atleast 8, that way we can start the research using all the labs the game gives to us.

> If the list is empty, that means you don't have any scientists specialized in Construction / Production. Just keep reading, I'll explain what to do in a moment.
{: .prompt-warning }

Now, click **Create Project** and it should appear in the queue.

### Switching Professions.

If you don't have any scientists with a specialization, you'll want to reassign one of your other scientists.

Head back to the main screen and click on the **Commanders** button.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research5.png)
_Image of commanders button._

Then, open up the **Scientists** list, and find a category where you have extra scientists.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research6.png)
_Image of scientists list._

Then, select one of the extra scientists---this will be the scientist whose profession changes.

And hit **Change Field**.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research7.png)
_Image of selecting a scientist._

Press **Yes** in the popup.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research8.png)
_Image of changing field popup._

Then select the desired field, and press **OK**.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/research9.png)
_Image of changing scientist specialization._

You have changed the scientist's field, now you can queue up your research (if you haven't already) or continue on to the next section.

In the same window you were just in, we're going to assign an **academy commandant**. Don't worry to much about who to assign, just assign someone from a science category you have extra of, for me, that's ground combat.

Click on a scientist.

Click on **RA1 Earth**.

And click assign.

We'll cover that window in more detail later, once we begin creating fleets.

## Shipyards

Next up, shipyards. Open up the **Economics** window (the window we've been using for research and industry) by clicking any of the first few buttons on the top bar of the main game screen.

Then press the **Shipyards** tab.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/shipyards1.png)
_Image of selecting shipyards._

Once again, lets go through the menu.

1. The left panel is for selecting the world.
2. This is where you can see all your shipyards and their current activities.
3. This is where you control the shipyards.
    - a. Here we can select the main action, upgrading, modifying, or expanding the shipyard itself.
    - b. Here we can select the action done *inside* the shipyard. Like building, refitting, or dismantling a ship.

We'll go more into depth on this tab once we start making ships.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/shipyards2.png)
_Image of shipyards._

For now, we just want to begin upgrading the size of our shipyards.

Select the smaller shipyard, which should be of type **N** (Naval) with a capacity of **1,000** tons.

With it selected, you'll want to head to the bottom of the screen and choose **Continual Capacity Upgrade** (which means it upgrades until hitting a target) and fill in **10,000** tons for the **Capacity Target**. Then, go ahead and hit **Set Activity**.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/shipyards3.png)
_Image of selecting shipyard._

Now, let's repeat that for the other shipyard, labeled **C** (Commercial). Choose **Continual Capacity Upgrade**, set the **Target Capacity** to **50,000** tons, and hit **Set Activity**.

Your shipyard screen should look similar to this.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/shipyards4.png)
_Image of shipyard results._

Increasing the size of the shipyards will allow us to build bigger ships, in the first shipyard we'll be building our first survey ship which won't be more than a few thousand tons, however, in the second shipyard, we're going to need to build either a freighter or a colony ship, and 50,000 might not even be enough, but don't worry too much about that for now.

## Governor

Just one more quick thing to do before we *actually* start playing the game.

Choose the **Governor** tab in the **Economics** window (the window we've been using).

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/governor1.png)
_Image of selecting governor._

The **Governor** screen is split into three sections.

1. I'm sure you can guess what this one is by now. Colony/Planet/System selection.
2. Here you can see the info about the current governor.
3. And here you can choose a governor, this'll be explained in a moment.

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/governor2.png)
_Image of governor._

First, you might as well tick **Automated Assignment for Colony** so you don't need to reselect governors when one dies.

Then, you'll want to select the bonuses you want. I chose **Production**, **Mining**, and **Wealth Creation**.

Lastly, click the number (5 in the image below) and type in a number reflecting the colonies importance.

Finally, click **Assign Colony Governor** to automatically assign one with your specified bonuses.

> If no governor appeared, it means the game couldn't find one matching your requirements. Try switching around the bonuses or reducing your importance number.
{: .prompt-warning }

![img-description](/assets/img/aurora4x/tutorial2/governor3.png)
_Image of selecting governor._

That governor will give some small boosts to actions on the planet, it's not to noticeable but every little bit helps.

# Conclusion

With that, we have finished our initial set of actions in this game. Next time, we'll start moving time forward and begin the first steps into building a survey ship.

Dont forget to save!
