Now that we've built some survey ships, let's send them off to survey.

If your ships haven't finished construction yet, come back once they do. I'd recommend building at least 2 survey ships, feel free to build more or stick to one.

# Naval Organization

The first thing you'll want to do once your ships have been built, it put them in fleets of their own.

First, open up the **Naval Organization** menu by pressin the ship button.

Then, locate your ships. In my case, they were both in the **Survey Fleet**. For now, ignore everything other than the left most panel.

Then, select one of your ships, and press detach. Then do the same for the others.

Now, you should see them in their own singular fleets.
