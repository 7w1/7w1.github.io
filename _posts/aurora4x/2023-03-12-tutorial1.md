# Creating a new game

## Game Options

After launching the game, you'll see a very bloated menu. For now, ignore everything and hit the **settings** button.

Once you click that, a new menu will pop up. Once again, ignore everything and hit **New Game**.

Then the menu will expand. First, you'll want to change the **Game Name**. You can set this to whatever you want---it won't effect game play. I'm setting the name to 'Tutorial Game'.

For this playthrough, I'd recommend leaving everything set to default.

Optionally,
- You could slow down the research, terraforming, and survey speed if you'd like some extra time to understand the game.
- You could decrease the NPR (Non-Player Races) generation chances if you'd rather avoid aliens for the time being.
- You could increase the minimum and maximum NPR distance so you can expand your empire further before encountering aliens.
- If your feeling adventurous you could add Planet X to the Sol System (Google "Planet X" if you don't know what it is).

But, I'll be leaving them as default.

Then hit **Create Game**.

## Race Options

Now, we're almost done.

Do the following:
1. Name your empire and homeworld. 
    - **Race Title** is really your empire's name.
2. Select your naming themes.
    - **System Theme** is for solar systems.
    - **Class Theme** is for ship classes.
    - **Rank Theme** is for military rankings.
    - **Name Theme** is for character names.
    - Everything can also be renamed manually whenever you want in game.
3. Select **Conventional Empire**.
    - We'll be using conventional empire because it helps slow down the introduction of features to make sure you don't get overloaded.
4. Select your race's **flag**, **portrait**, **ship hull**, and **station**.
    - These are just cosmetic and don't have any effects in gameplay.
5. Then you can go ahead and press **Create Race**, which will begin the game!

## Display Settings

Now that you're in the game, one thing I *highly* recommend is turning on **Events** in the **Display** options on the left side of the screen.

Then, if you have a second monitor, I would open the **Events** window and dragging it over.

Inside the events window you can also customize the colors. You can download my color preset [here](/assets/files/aurora4x/tutorial1/event_colors.csv), or you can make your own as you play!

If you choose to use mine, you can enable it by following these steps:

Click on **Import Colors**.

Press **OK** in the popup.

Select the **event_colors.csv** file you just downloaded, and hit **Open**.

Dont forget to save!
