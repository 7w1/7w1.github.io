# WIP

# Can't wait?
1. Fork this repo.
2. (Optional) Install jekyll and its dependencies if you'd like to preview the website locally.
3. Create a file in _posts with whatever you want.
    - Copy existing posts to see what you must include. (The headers)
    - See [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/), [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/) for more info about formatting.
    - Compare with existing posts for formatting consistency.
4. If you haven't already, add yourself to _data/authors.yml.
5. Make a pull request and wait for approval. Even if you have issues with formatting, feel free to make a pull request, I can modify and improve it for you.
6. See your changes on the website!
